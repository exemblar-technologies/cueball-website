Altering your browser or device settings will stop you from receiving these at any moment.</p>

A small number of our advertising partners are also involved in the display of advertisements. We may also disclose information about you to other members of our organisation or the government.</p>

<p className="mb-0">Where we process your personal information</p>
<p className="text-white ">We have locations in the United States, UK, and Africa where we process your information.</p>

<p className="mb-0">Your rights</p>
<p className="text-white ">In some cases, you have the right to access your information, receive a copy of your information, request that we delete your information, or request that we restrict how we use your data for certain purposes, such as targeted marketing and advertising.</p>

<p className="mb-0">Changes to the Privacy Policy</p>
<p className="text-white ">In the event that this Policy is revised or amended, the revised or amended version will be made available on this page. We will let you know.</p>
